RideAlong

RideAlong is an app that will record the route you travel.

The idea behind this app is to record the route you have ridden when on a motorbike and out for a directionless fun ride rather than a commute.




Route Recorder:

This small selection of screens allow the user to start to record a route. Once the choice to record a route has been made the user needs to enter a route name before recording can begin. 

Once the name has been entered and the recording has started the map will show the users location and begin to draw a blue line to show the route they have travelled. 

When a route is recording the user is able to attach a photo from the camera (device allowing) or the photo library to a location on the route. Simply select the 'Add Image' button and the location of the photo is calculated automatically.

After the user has finished their journey they are able to stop the route recording.





Route Review:

This selection of screen allows the user to review and revisit their recorded journeys.

From a list the user is able to select the route by name. They will then be directed to a map, showing the route as a blue line with pins marking the location of the photos they attached as they travelled.

When a use selects a pin, they are moved to a collection of images that have been stored at that location. 

When viewing an image the user is presented with the option to view more images from the same location.

If the user selects an image from the selection of images for the same location they are able to view the image in a larger view and to also save the image to that same location on their route.





Build, Run Access

This app has no logins or other special requirements other than adding your own Flickr API key to the Constants.swift file.

Please run the app on a device or the simulator.

To test the routing, I used the simulator's ability to represent a journey along a freeway.
